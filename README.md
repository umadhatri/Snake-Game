# Snake-Game
This is my repo for a snake game

# Intro to Snake Game
We all have played a snake game in the past. Whether it was on that sturdy and durable Nokia phone or on the TV Game module or maybe even yesterday on your smart phone. It's that Snake game that I am talking about here.

# How I built it?
I built with python by impoting 'pygame' 

# What I think of it?
Sure, it's not the most sophisiticated game out there but, I'm pretty proud of it!
